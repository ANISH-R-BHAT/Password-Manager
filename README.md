Project Overview: 
Password Manager is a desktop application designed to provide users 
with a secure and user- friendly platform for managing their passwords. 
The users can store, retrieve, update and delete their passwords of 
different applications (labels). The project aims to enhance online security 
by encrypting the passwords given by the user, using an algorithm called 
Advanced Encryption Standard(AES), and storing the encrypted form in 
the database. Similarly, decryption of encrypted passwords are made 
using the same algorithm when the user tries to retrieve the passwords 
from the database. This ensures that the application is resistant to cyber 
attacks like Database hacking.

Project Technologies:
-  Java Swings (Frontend)
-  Java (Backend and Application Logic)
-  SQL(Database) 
-  AES-256 Encryption (Security)

Project Setup:  
-  Ensure that you have necessary IDE such as IntelliJ/ Eclipse/ NetBeans/ VS Code installed and setupped in your system to run java application.
-  Create a project in your IDE and name it as PasswordManager.
-  Create a package named PasswordManagerClasses inside the project.
-  Create classes/ files with .java extension named “Login”, “Signup”, “Conn”, “PasswordManager”, “Operations”, “AES”, ”Validator”, “PasswordGenerator” and
   copy paste the code in the respective classes mentioned above.
-  Ensure that you have MySQL Database in your system.
-  Add file(library) named “mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar” into the External Libraries section for accessing the MySQL Driver.
-  In MySQL Database execute the commands present in “Commands.txt”.
-  In “Conn.java”, replace the username and password with actual username and password of your MySQL Database.
-  Run the file named “Login.java” and experience the application!
